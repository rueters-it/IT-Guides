# Troubleshoot: Intermittent Wifi 

If the wifi keeps dropping and reconnecting (intermittent connectivity), even after checking if the ISP says that the signal is strong, then the issue is likely local rather than at the ISP level. 

## Understanding the Issue 

## Common Causes 

## Troubleshoot
- Check with ISP to test network connection/signal
- Check the modem and router
- Test wired vs. wireless connections
- Check for Wi-Fi interference
- Update Firware and Drivers
- Check for Device or Software Conflicts
- Replace Equipment if Needed
- Collect Logs and Escalate to ISP
- Change Wi-Fi channel
- Move router higher/center
- Use mesh/extenders

### Update Firware and Drivers
1. Log into your router's admin panel
2. CHeck for firmware updates
3. Update your network drivers on your computer (especially Wi-Fi drivers)
