# Troubleshoot: Intermittent Wifi 

If the wifi keeps dropping and reconnecting (intermittent connectivity), even after checking if the ISP says that the signal is strong, then the issue is likely local rather than at the ISP level. 

## Understanding the Issue 

## Common Causes 
1. Wi-Fi interference
2. Overheating or Failing Router
3. Too Many Devices on Network
4. Power Supply or Voltage Fluctuations
5. Modem Issues
6. Driver or Firware Problems
7. Device specific issues
8. DHCP or IP conflicts
9. Weak Signal Strength or Coverage
10. Security Settings or Network Flood

## Test

### Ping Test
1. Conduct a ping test to Google (8.8.8.8)
2. If you see "Request time out" or big delays, the problem is likely your network and not the device.  

## Troubleshoot
- Check with ISP to test network connection/signal
- Check the modem and router
- Test wired vs. wireless connections
- Check for Wi-Fi interference
- Update Firware and Drivers
- Check for Device or Software Conflicts
- Replace Equipment if Needed
- Collect Logs and Escalate to ISP
- Change Wi-Fi channel
- Move router higher/center
- Use mesh/extenders

### Update Firware and Drivers
1. Log into your router's admin panel
2. CHeck for firmware updates
3. Update your network drivers on your computer (especially Wi-Fi drivers)
