# Mouspad

## Issue: Mousepad Unfunctional

### Check mousepad settings 
Check mousepad settings in Windows to ensure it's enabled and sensitivity is adjusted.
1. Go to Settings > Devices > Touchpad
2. Ensure the touchpad is enabled and adjust sensitivity or gestures if needed

### Update touchpad drivers 
1. Right-click the Start button and navigate to Device Manager
2. Expand "Mice and other pointing devices" or "Human Interface Devices"
3. Right-click touchpad driver and select "Update driver"
4. If updating doesn't help, try uninstalling the driver and restarting your computer to allow Windows to reinstall it automatically. 

### Roll back drivers
1. Uf the issue started after a specific update, try rolling back to the previous driver version
2. To do this, go to Device Manager (right-click the Start button click on it) and right-click on the touchpad and select "Properties"
3. Go to the Driver tab and click "Roll Back Driver" (if available)

### Consider a System Restore 
1. If the problem persists, you can try a system restore point before the update
2. To do this, search for and open Control Panel > System and Security > System
3. Click on "System Protection" and then "System Restore"
4. Choose a restore point before the issue occurred and follow the on-screen instructions

### Check for Third-Pary Software Conflicts 
1. Sometimes, newly installed software can interfere with the touchpad.
2. Try disabling or uninstalling recently installed software to see if it resolves the issue.

### Use an external mouse 
1. If you have an external mouse, connect it to your laptop to see if it works.
2. This can help determine if the problem is isolated to the touchpad itself.
